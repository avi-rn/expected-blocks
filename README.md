# Blocks Over Expected (BOE)
Trained XGBoost model to predict the number of shots a team would block using fbref.com public data.
Data was scraped using https://levelup.gitconnected.com/quickly-and-easily-scrape-fbref-using-just-pandas-773b294f86a0 as a guide.
The higher number of shots you block the higher number of goals you are expected to concede.
The difference between the number of shots you block and the expected number of blocks is Blocks Over Expected (BOE).
This can tell us the stylistic differences between teams when it comes to attempting to block shots.
